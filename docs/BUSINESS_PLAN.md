# Silent Exodus - Business & Release Plan

**Last Updated:** Session 2024

---

## 1. YOUR SITUATION

**Profile:** Analyst using AI to build games. No coding background. No budget for hiring.

**Advantage:** You ship faster than traditional devs. Code is a tool, not an identity.

**Goal:** Passive income from multiple small games (~€50/month each)

---

## 2. SILENT EXODUS - RELEASE CHECKLIST

### Must Have (Before Release)
| Task | Effort | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| Add background music (CC0 ambient) | 2 hours | ❌ |
| Add share-friendly ending screen | 4 hours | ❌ |
| Make responsive (1280px minimum) | 1 day | ❌ |
| Test full playthrough (no crashes) | 2 hours | ❌ |
| Create itch.io page with GIFs | 1 day | ❌ |

### Nice to Have (Post-Release Updates)

| Items that boost colony outcomes | 1 day | ❌ |
| Sound effects (clicks, alerts) | 4 hours | ❌ |

## 3. THE SHARE ENDING SCREEN

**Critical for virality.** When a run ends, show:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                    THE EXODUS COMPLETE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Colony: [GENERATED NAME]
Planet: [Planet Name], Sector [X]
Survivors: [X] of 5 crew

[For each living crew - their legacy]
[For each dead crew - how they died OR "Lost in Sector X"]

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                    50 YEARS LATER
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Population: [Number based on success]
[One-line summary of colony fate]

The children [call Earth / remember Earth as / have forgotten Earth]

                    [SHARE]  [NEW VOYAGE]
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

### Narrative Cohesion Rules
- Dead crew: Cannot have positive legacies
- Dead crew: Show "Lost to [cause] in Sector [X]" or "Killed by [hazard]"
- Living crew legacies based on:
  - Role (Aris = medical, Jaxon = engineering, etc.)
  - Stress level at end
  - Whether they were injured
  - Special events triggered during run

### Example Legacies (Living Crew)

**Aris (Medic):**
- Low stress: "Founded the colony's first hospital"
- High stress: "Never practiced medicine again"
- If SYMBIOTE revived someone: "Studied the Mycelium until her death"

**Jaxon (Engineer):**
- Low stress: "Built the water reclamation system that saved thousands"
- High stress: "Spent his remaining years warning of disasters that never came"
- If ship was badly damaged: "Swore never to touch an engine again"

**Vance (Security):**
- Low stress: "Trained the colony's first defense force"
- High stress: "Kept watch until the day he died. No one ever came."
- If crew died on his watch: "Blamed himself. Walked into the wilderness in Year 12."

**Mira (Tech):**
- Low stress: "Mapped the entire continent. They named a mountain after her."
- High stress: "Spent decades trying to contact the signal. No one answered."
- If A.U.R.A. was adversarial: "Spent her life trying to understand A.U.R.A.'s betrayal"

**Commander:**
- Low stress: "Led the colony for 30 years. Died in her sleep, beloved."
- High stress: "Stepped down after Year 1. Never spoke of the journey."

## 4. PLATFORM STRATEGY

### Primary: Itch.io
- **Model:** Free + "Pay What You Want" (suggested $3-5)
- **Why:** Low friction, indie-friendly audience, no approval process
- **Expected:** €50-200 lifetime if marketed well

### Secondary: Kongregate / CrazyGames (Later)
- **Model:** Ad revenue share
- **Why:** Passive traffic, no marketing needed
- **Requires:** Their SDK integration
- **Expected:** €5-20/month if game gets featured

### Avoid (For Now):
- **Steam:** €100 fee, high expectations, needs significant polish
- **Mobile:** Complete UI rebuild, ads feel wrong for narrative games

---

## 5. MARKETING PLAN (Zero Budget)

### Week of Release
1. Post to r/WebGames (screenshot + link)
2. Post to r/incremental_games (if any idle elements)
3. Post to r/IndieGaming
4. Post to Interactive Fiction Community Forum
5. Share in text game Discord servers

### Ongoing
- Reply to every comment/review
- Post devlog updates on itch.io
- Cross-post interesting bugs/stories to Twitter/Reddit

### Free Marketing Assets Needed
- 3 GIFs showing gameplay moments
- 1 "ending screen" screenshot
- 5-line description that hooks

## 6. PASSIVE INCOME MATH

### Realistic Scenario (Single Game)
| Month | Itch (PWYW) | Total |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | €30-50 | €30-50 |
| 2 | €10-20 | €40-70 |
| 3 | €5-10 | €45-80 |
| 4+ | €2-5/month | Slow trickle |

**Lifetime estimate:** €100-300 for a well-received small game

### Portfolio Strategy (Multiple Games)
| Games | Monthly Total | Timeline |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| 1 game | €5-20/month | Now |
| 3 games | €15-50/month | +2 months |
| 5 games | €30-100/month | +4 months |
| 10 games | €50-200/month | +8 months |

**Key insight:** No single game makes €50/month. A PORTFOLIO might.

## 7. NEXT GAMES (Ideas)

After Silent Exodus, build smaller/faster:

### Seedship-Style (1 week builds)
- **Colony Lottery:** You ARE the planet. Ships arrive. Accept or reject colonists.
- **Last Signal:** You're a dying probe. Send one final message. What do you say?
- **The Vote:** 5 survivors, 1 escape pod. Convince them you should live.

### Slightly Larger (2-3 week builds)
- **Station Keeper:** Manage an abandoned space station. Text-based.
- **The Drift:** Generational ship. Each generation is one decision.

### Key Principle
Each game should be:
- Completable in 10-20 minutes
- Shareable ending
- One core mechanic
- Replayable through randomness

---

## 8. TIMELINE

**You're closer than you think. But you're not competing with Chiron Gate. You're building a portfolio.**
